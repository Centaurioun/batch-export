**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Upload a test file**
> Most of the times, the issues you encounter while using the extension appear because of a specific setting existing in your working file (e.g. some objects are grouped, an object is a clone of another object etc.). This makes reproducing the issue on my side difficult, maybe even impossible.

This file doesn't have to be the file you got the error on (as this one most probably contains private data), but a **_simple file in which you can reproduce the same issue_**. It can be similar to the file from this repository in the [test directory](https://github.com/StefanTraistaru/batch-export/tree/master/test). You can try and add some layers and objects and organize them in a similar way to your original file.

**Log**
